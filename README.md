# Teleop Navigation Options

## Browser-based

* Web page and/or Android App via a REST API

## Software

* Google speech API (https://cloud.google.com/speech/). 

* Google vision API (https://cloud.google.com/vision/). Same exercise as speech, but
using pictures to control a robot.

* Slack bot to learn how to write a chat bot. Cool APIs that we could use include:
https://api.ai and https://recast.ai Both make building a bot and processing natural language really easy.

* Twilio (https://www.twilio.com) to enable control via voice or sms.

* Face expressions (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/emotion/)

* OpenCV to recognize a colored object moving in a particular direction.
The object can either be hand held or it can be an object like a 
gold fish (http://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-27241688/smart-tank-time-to-take-the-fish-for-a-walk)
